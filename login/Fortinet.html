<p>Fortinet is an American multinational corporation headquartered in Sunnyvale, California. It develops and markets cybersecurity software and appliances and services, such as firewalls, anti-virus, intrusion prevention and endpoint security.

Fortinet was founded in 2000 by brothers Ken and Michael Xie. The company's first product was FortiGate, a firewall, later adding wireless access points, sandboxing, and messaging security. By 2004, Fortinet had raised over $90 million in funding. 
The company went public in November 2009, raising $156 million through an initial public offering.[4] In 2016, Fortinet released its Security Fabric architecture that included integration and automation with other network security devices and third-party vendors.
